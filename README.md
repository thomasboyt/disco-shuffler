## what is [this](http://disco.zone/)

it displays a fullscreen video of a random song in `playlist.yaml`.

## so you made the most complex possible youtube shuffler

yes. but i'm probably going to replace the video with some sick disco gifs or something, i dunno.

## what's next

* [x] Playlist file containing songs
* [ ] Display playlist of all songs
* [ ] Client- and server- side routes/navigation for songs (by index in playlist)
* [ ] Server-side rendering for React components (pipe dream)
